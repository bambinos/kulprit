## Pull request step-by-step

The preferred workflow for contributing to Kulprit is to fork the GitHub [repository](https://github.com/bambinos/kulprit), clone it to your local machine, and develop on a feature branch.

### Steps

1. Fork the [project repository](https://github.com/bambinos/kulprit/) by clicking on the 'Fork' button near the top right of the main repository page. This creates a copy of the code under your GitHub user account.

1. Clone your fork of the Kulprit repo from your GitHub account to your local disk, and add the base repository as a remote:

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:<your GitHub handle>/kulprit.git
   cd pymc
   git remote add upstream git@github.com:bambinos/kulprit.git
   ```

1. Create a ``feature`` branch to hold your development changes:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b my-feature
   ```

   Always use a ``feature`` branch. It's good practice to never routinely work on the ``main`` branch of any repository.

1. Project requirements are in ``requirements.txt``, and libraries used for development are in ``requirements-dev.txt``.
   The easiest (and recommended) way to set up a development environment is via [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html):

   ```bash
   conda create --name kulprit-dev
   ```

   ```bash
   conda activate kulprit-dev
   pip install -e .
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
   ```


1. Develop the feature on your feature branch.

   ```bash
   git checkout my-feature   # no -b flag because the branch is already created
   ```

1. Before committing, run `pre-commit` checks.

   ```bash
   pip install pre-commit
   pre-commit install
   ```

1. Add changed files using ``git add`` and then ``git commit`` files:

   ```bash
   $ git add modified_files
   $ git commit
   ```

   to record your changes locally.

1. After committing, it is a good idea to sync with the base repository in case there have been any changes:
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git rebase upstream/main
   ```

   Then push the changes to the fork in your GitHub account with:

   ```bash
   git push -u origin my-feature
   ```

1. Go to the GitHub web page of your fork of the PyMC repo.
   Click the 'Pull request' button to send your changes to the project's maintainers for review.
   This will send a notification to the committers.
